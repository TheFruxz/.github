## Welcome to fur.ink! ðŸ‘‹

We are a small team of 5 developers developing [fur.ink](https://fur.ink), an artist commissioning and payments platform.

Our aim is to create a modern alternative to existing platforms like FurAffinity or Twitter, allowing artists to post commission information to their audience, and users to find artists with styles that suit their wants and price range. We embrace the open-source world, and our frontend applications, including the website and mobile app, are all open-source under a dual MIT or Apache 2.0 license.

## Projects

- [@furink/web](https://github.com/furinkapp/furink/tree/main/apps/web) - our core web application, accessible at [www.fur.ink](https://fur.ink).
- [@furink/mobile](https://github.com/furinkapp/furink/tree/main/apps/mobile) - our mobile application, for on-the-go posting and info devouring.

## Contributions

Contributions are very much welcome! To contribute, look at our contribution guidelines, then open a feature request, or bug report in the [issues section](https://github.com/furinkapp/furink/issues) of the central repository.

The backend is currently closed source and not accepting contributions, but we are actively working on a public API to allow automation of information, as well as webhook support to enable users to create custom feeds for commission information.
